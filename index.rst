---------------
Getting Started
---------------

It’s 3:45AM on a Monday morning. You are woken to the sound of your phone indicating 17 missed calls and 12 pending messages. Without any other need to look, you know things areabout to get rough.


A quick review of your messages tells you that your tier one application infrastructure is currently experiencing an outage. The good news is that your team, being as great as they are, has narrowed the likely culprits down to a component failure somewhere within the storage array. Unfortunately, at 9:00AM sharp the CEO and members of the executive board will be joining you for a review of the soon to be launched new E-Commerce application which will pivot the organization into the direction of the company’s future.


You and your team are assembling with 3 hours to resolve this solution. After some discussion, it is quickly determined that there are two choices:

- 1.Reschedule the mornings meeting until the discussions with the multiple vendors supporting your tier 1 environment can troubleshoot the issues, identify the solution and execute a response.
- 2.Leverage a recent POC which has not yet gone in to testing, migrate the application from the Test/Dev environment on to this new platform and execute with the innovation and creativity that your team has made a name for themselves by doing.


Leadership has made it abundantly clear, there is no real choice. It’s time to try something new.


Your team has 3 hours to Escape the Challenges of Legacy Architecture the story below within the environment provided to you. Your Nutanix Account Executive and Nutanix SE will be available for technical support should any unexpected failures occur.


Throughout this session you will:

  -Log in to and use a Nutanix Frame DTaaS account
  -Access a Nutanix Cluster-Create an image within Prism Central-Create a VLan
  -Create a Storage pool
  -Create a VM
  -Import a VM via Nutanix Move-Convert a VM from ESXi to Nutanix AHV
  -Establish a series of Automated Check governing over the VM
  -Create a Micro-segmentation policy for your new application to protect it

  Upon successful completion, your team will be rewarded for X-Scaping traditional Infrastructure pain with something to enjoy with your newfound free time now that your environment has been simplified and streamlined.

Initial Setup
+++++++++++++

- Take note of the *Passwords* being used.
- Log into your virtual desktops (connection info below)

Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

If provisioned from the marketing pool:

- **Cluster Name** - MKT\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.21.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.55.37

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - IP Address
     - Description
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .37
     - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .39
     - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .40
     - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Credentials
...........

.. note::

  The *<Cluster Password>* is unique to each cluster and will be provided by the leader of the Workshop.
